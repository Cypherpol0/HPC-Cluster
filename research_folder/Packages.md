# <u> **NIXOS SYSTEM PACKAGES** </u>

## 1. <u> Packages in use </u>

* <u> Vim: </u>
Vim stands for "Vi IMproved" and is a free, open-source text editing program made available for UNIX-like systems in 1991. It can be used in plain text mode or with a visual interface and works on all types of computers and devices. Learning to use Vim is relatively easy, but it requires constant practice. It is celebrated for its speed, efficiency, and power, partly due to its compact size that allows it to run directly in a command window (although it also has a graphical version). One of the main reasons for its efficiency is that it can be used without drop-down menus or a mouse, using only keyboard shortcuts, such as pressing "d" to delete text, "c" to change it, "f" to search for something and so on. Street. Combining these shortcuts with numbers allows one to do the same thing multiple times. Also, doubling a command, like "yy", can do something across the entire page.
Vim doesn't take up much space in a computer's memory, making it expandable. There are various plugins to extend the functionalities. The best way to configure it is through the .vimrc file, which can be opened and configured using Vim.

* <u> Wget: </u>
Wget is a software program developed by the GNU Project that allows users to download content and files from different internet servers. Its name stands for World Wide Web and "get," indicating its function to fetch and download data through several protocols, including FTP, SFTP, HTTP, and HTTPS.
This utility is written in portable C programming language, so runable on any Unix-based system. It's also adaptable to other widely used operating systems like Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, and AmigaOS, among others.

* <u> Git: </u>
It is a widely used, open-source, free-distributed version control system (VCS) that focuses on the content within files instead of the file's attributes. It ensures security through SHA-256 encryption and maintains a comprehensive log of information, making it ideal for efficiently managing projects of any size. Designed for software development, Git monitors modifications in source code, emphasising quick performance, the integrity of data, and collaborative support. This allows several developers to contribute to the development process in a non-linear fashion simultaneously.

* <u> Openssh: </u>
It is the open-source version of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol. It is mainly utilised for securely managing systems, transferring files, and facilitating communication across the internet or other unsecured networks. It secures user passwords, identities, and all transmitted data through encryption, safeguarding against unauthorised interception and theft.

* <u> Gcc: </u>
The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a free, open-source compiling and development tool available on multiple operating systems, including Linux and Windows. It supports a wide range of programming languages, especially C and C++.
Being a versatile toolchain, it processes code from compilation to generation of executable files. Preprocess, compile, assemble and link code, integrating external libraries to produce executables. Used primarily in the Linux ecosystem, it is an integral part of compiling most software, including the Linux kernel. GCC's GPL version 3 license grants broad software freedoms bolstered by a strong support network of a large community of developers and contributors. Its modular design improves maintainability, facilitates debugging, and makes it easy to add new features.

* <u> Bat: </u>
Bat, or "a cat clone with wings", has similar functionality to cat, awk, more and sed, i.e. concatenating files together, but more visually appealing with more extra context and colourful results. To quickly preview the contents of a text file without opening it in an extensive application, often concatenate one file to nothing. The command is Git-compatible by default. In a Git repository with the --diff command, it is possible to display only changes from the latest commit. It also allows highlighting a series of lines in a file, not the syntax, but marks each line with a filled box.

* <u> Calc: </u>
